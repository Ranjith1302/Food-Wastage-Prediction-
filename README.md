# 🍽️ Food Wastage Prediction System

A machine learning-powered system designed to analyze restaurant operations and predict food wastage based on historical data. The goal is to reduce food waste through data-driven insights using a full modeling pipeline with an optimized XGBoost Regressor.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a predictive model for food wastage using various machine learning techniques. It includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Outlier detection (IQR & Z-score)
- Feature engineering & encoding
- Multiple model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning (XGBoost via GridSearchCV)
- Model interpretability using SHAP
- Final model export using `pickle`

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SHAP (for model explainability)
- Pickle (for model serialization)

## 📊 Dataset Description

- **Source**: Simulated dataset containing restaurant operation data.
- **Target**: `wastage_food_amount` (amount of food wasted in units).
- **Features**:
  - `type_of_food`, `event_type`, `number_of_guests`, `quantity_of_food`, `storage_conditions`, `purchase_history`, `seasonality`, `preparation_method`, `geographical_location`, `pricing`

## 🔍 Key Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Data Cleaning
- Normalized column names
- Filled missing values with median
- Removed duplicates
- Detected outliers using IQR and Z-score

### 🔨 Step 2: Feature Engineering
- Categorical encoding with `OneHotEncoder`
- Scaling numerical features using `MinMaxScaler`

### 🤖 Step 3: Model Training & Evaluation
- Models compared: `LinearRegression`, `DecisionTree`, `RandomForest`, `SVR`, `KNN`, `XGBoost`
- Hyperparameter tuning done via `GridSearchCV` for XGBoost
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, R² Score

### 🧠 Step 4: Explainability
- SHAP used to interpret XGBoost predictions
- Summary plot shows top influential features
